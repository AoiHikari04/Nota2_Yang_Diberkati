# Analysis


**Things that need to do:**
- Requirement Determination
- Requirement structuring

**Method of Gathering Requirements:**
- Individual Interview
- Interview groups
- Observing
- Study business documents

**Create the FDD**
- Shows all the necessary features by dividing it into modules and manageable nodes

**Processing Information from requirement gathering:**
- Data Flow Diagram(DFD)
- Data Dictionary
- Process Descriptions

Data Flow Diagrams:
- Show the movement of data inside the systems

Data Dictionary:
- Shows the database of the data
- Shows attribute and characteristic of the entity

Process Description tools:
- Presentation of the process/features inside the systems

# Implementation

- Coding
- Testing
- Installation

**7 Different Types of Tests:**
1. Inspections
	- Inspect code for any error
2. Walkthrough
	- Review the code before formal testing
	- an informal process
3. Desk checking
	- Program code are run manually by the Reviewer
4.  Unit Testing
	- Testing each module alone 
	- attempting to discover any error on a smaller scale
5. Integration Testing
	- Process of bringing together all the modules 
	- modules are typically integrated top-down, incremental fashion
6. System testing
	- Bring together all the programs for testing purposes
7.  Stub Testing
	- Substitutes few code to test the programs
