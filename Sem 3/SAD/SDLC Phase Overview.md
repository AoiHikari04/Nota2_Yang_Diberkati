<h1>Analysis</h1>


**Things that need to do:**
- Requirement Determination
- Requirement structuring

**Method of Gathering Requirements:**
- Individual Interview
- Interview groups
- Observing
- Study business documents

**Create the FDD**
- Shows all the necessary features by dividing it into modules and manageable nodes

**Processing Information from requirement gathering:**
- Data Flow Diagram(DFD)
- Data Dictionary
- Process Descriptions

Data Flow Diagrams:
- Show the movement of data inside the systems

Data Dictionary:
- Shows the database of the data
- Shows attribute and characteristic of the entity

Process Description tools:
- Presentation of the process/features inside the systems
- Shows the status of a certain output divided by the situation that might happen(lol idk)

<h1>Implementation</h1>

- Coding
- Testing
- Installation

**7 Different Types of Tests:**
1. Inspections
	- Inspect code for any error
2. Walkthrough
	- Review the code before formal testing
	- an informal process
3. Desk checking
	- Program code are run manually by the Reviewer
4.  Unit Testing
	- Testing each module alone 
	- attempting to discover any error on a smaller scale
5. Integration Testing
	- Process of bringing together all the modules 
	- modules are typically integrated top-down, incremental fashion
6. System testing
	- Bring together all the programs for testing purposes
7.  Stub Testing
	- Substitutes few code to test the programs

**Installation**
1. Direct Installation
2. Parallel Installation
3. Single-Location Installation
4. Phased Installation

DeepSeek:

Letâ€™s imagine youâ€™re building a LEGO castle. Hereâ€™s how the installation types work:

1. **Direct Installation**  
   This is like building your LEGO castle all at once. You take all the pieces and put them together in one go. Done! Easy and quick, but you need all the pieces ready.

2. **Parallel Installation**  
   This is like building two LEGO castles at the same time. Maybe one for you and one for your friend. You work on both together, but it takes more effort because youâ€™re doing double the work.

3. **Single-Location Installation**  
   This is like building your LEGO castle in one special spot, like on the kitchen table. You keep everything in one place, and itâ€™s easier to manage because itâ€™s all right there.

4. **Phased Installation**  
   This is like building your LEGO castle step by step. First, you build the walls, then the towers, and finally the roof. You take your time and do it in small parts, so itâ€™s not too hard.

So, itâ€™s all about how you want to build your LEGO castleâ€”fast, in two places, in one spot, or bit by bit! ðŸ˜Š
