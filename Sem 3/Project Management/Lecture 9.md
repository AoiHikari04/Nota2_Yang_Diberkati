<h1>Measurement and Evaluation</h1>

<h2>Project Progress Report Format</h2>
- Current Status of Project
1. Schedule
2. Cost
3. Scope
- Cumulative trends

- Problems and issues since last report
1. Actions and resolution
2. new variances and problems identified

<h2>The project control process</h2>
Control
- The Process of comparing actual performance against planned
Project Control Steps
- Setting a baseline plan
- Measuring progress and performance
- Comparing plan against actual
- Taking action
Tools
- Gantt charts
- Control Charts

<h2>Development of an earned value costs</h2>

- Corrects the failure most monitoring systems

DeepSeek:

- **PV (Planned Value):** This represents the budgeted cost for work scheduled to be completed by a certain date. It indicates how much work should have been done according to the plan.

- **AC (Actual Cost):** This is the actual cost incurred for the work completed by the specified date. It shows the real expenditure on the project.

 - **EV (Earned Value):** This is the budgeted cost for work actually performed by the specified date. It measures the value of the work completed in terms of the budget.

- **CPI (Cost Performance Index):** This is a ratio of EV to AC (CPI = EV/AC). It indicates the cost efficiency of the project. A CPI greater than 1 means the project is under budget, while a CPI less than 1 means it is over budget.

- **SPI (Schedule Performance Index):** This is a ratio of EV to PV (SPI = EV/PV). It indicates the schedule efficiency of the project. An SPI greater than 1 means the project is ahead of schedule, while an SPI less than 1 means it is behind schedule.

- **Baseline Budget**: The original plan for how much money you think you'll need to finish your project. It's like a shopping list for your project.

- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**: Tells you how much money the whole project is supposed to cost by the time it’s finished, according to the baseline budget. It's like looking at how much your shopping list will cost in total.

- **Control Chart**: A visual tool that helps you see how well your project is going over time. It shows if things are staying on track or if something went wrong.

- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: Like a scorecard for how much money you've spent. It compares how much you’ve actually spent vs. how much you thought you would spend. A good score means you're staying on budget.

- **Cost Variance (CV)**: Shows if you’re spending more or less than you expected. It's like checking if you have more or less money than you thought you would.

- **Earned Value (EV)**: Shows how much work you’ve actually completed in terms of money. It’s like saying, “I’ve finished this much of the project, and it should cost this much.”

- **Estimated Cost at Completion—Forecasted (EACf)**: Your guess at how much money the whole project will cost at the end, based on what’s happening right now. It's like predicting how much your shopping will cost after looking at what you’ve already bought.

- **Estimated Cost at Completion—Revised Estimates (EACre)**: A new prediction of how much the project will cost, updated with new information if something changed in the plan. It's like checking your shopping list and adjusting it after seeing what’s on sale.

- **Percent Complete Index—Budget Costs (PCIB)**: How much of the budgeted work you’ve finished, shown as a percentage. It's like saying, "I’m done with 50% of my shopping list."

- **Percent Complete Index—Actual Costs (PCIC)**: How much of the project you’ve actually done, based on how much money you’ve spent. It tells you if you're spending money the way you thought you would.

- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: Tells you if you're behind or ahead on your schedule. If the number is high, you’re doing well, and if it’s low, you’re falling behind.

- **Schedule Variance (SV)**: Tells you how much ahead or behind you are compared to the plan. It’s like checking if you’re ahead or behind in your shopping trip.

- **Scope Creep**: When the project keeps growing and you add more and more tasks without planning for them. It's like saying, “Oh, I need to buy this too!” and your shopping list keeps getting longer.

- **To Complete Performance Index (TCPI)**: Tells you how well you need to do for the rest of the project to stay on budget. It’s like saying, “From now on, I have to be really careful with my shopping so I don’t spend too much!”

- **Tracking Gantt Chart**: A chart that shows the progress of the project over time. It looks like a bar chart that helps you see what’s finished and what’s left to do.

- **Variance at Completion (VAC)**: Tells you the difference between the budget you planned and the money you expect to need to finish the project. It’s like saying, “I planned to spend $100, but I think I’ll need $120 by the end.”
