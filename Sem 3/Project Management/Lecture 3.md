### Learning Objectives

Elaborate the purpose and importance of project management from the perspective if planning, tracking and completion of project

### Step 1: Defining the project scope

**Project Scope**
- A definition of the end result of the project
- plan/service/product in a specific and measurable terms

<hr style="border: 1px solid Grey;" />

**Purpose of the Scope Statement**
- To clearly define the deliverables for the client/end user
- Measuring project success
- To be use in planning

<hr style="border: 1px solid Grey;" />

**Project Scope Checklist**
1. Project objectives
2. Deliverables
3. Milestone
4. Technical requirements
5. Limits and exclusions
6. Reviews with customer

<hr style="border: 1px solid Grey;" />

**Terms and Definitions**

Scope Statements
- Also called statements of work

Project Charter
- contain expanded ver of scope statement
- Document authorizing the project manager to initiate the project

Scope Creep
- Tendency for the project to expand due to change in:
	- Requirements
	- specific
	- priorities


<hr style="border: 2px solid Grey;" />

### Step 2: Establishing Project Priorities

**Causes of project Trade-Offs**
- shifts in the relative importance of criterions 

**Managing the priorities of project trade-offs**
- **Constrain** : a parameter is a fixed requirement (x leh ubah)
- **Enhance** : optimizing a criterion over others (pentingkan)
- **Accept** : reducing a criterion requirement (Ubah ikot kesesuaian)


**Project management trade-offs**
```mermaid

B[Quality]

    A{Scope} o--o C{Time} o--o D{Cost}
    D o--o A
```
- can only trade one at a time, if trade too much can reduce the quality of the project

<hr style="border: 2px solid Grey;" />

### Step 3: Creating the Work Breakdown Structure

**Work Breakdown Structure**
- A hierarchical outline that identifies products and work in a project
- Defines the relationship between work and deliverables

```mermaid 
graph TD
	Title[Hierachical Breakdown] 
	--> A
    A[Project] --> B[Deliverable]
    B --> C[Subdeliverable]
    C --> D[Lowest subdeliverable]
    D --> E[Cost account]
    E --> F[Work package]


	Title1[Description]
	A1(Complete project)
	B1(Major deliverable) 
	C1(Supporting deliverables)
	
	D1(Lowest management 
	responsibility level)
	
	E1(Grouping of work packages 
	for monitoring progress and 
	responsibility)
	
	F1(Identifiable work activities)

Title1 --> A1
A1 --> B1 --> C1 --> D1 --> E1 --> F1

```

**How WBS Helps the project Manager**

- Facilitates evaluation cost, times, and technical performance
- Breakdown work based on hierachy
- Helps manage plan, schedule and budget

Example:

**Work Packages**

lowest level of WBS
- output oriented
	1. Defines work
	2. identifies time to complete
	3. identifies cost
	4. identifies resource needed
	5. identifies person responsible
	6. identifies monitoring point

### Step 4: Integrating the WBS with the Origanisation

Depicts how the firm is organized to discharge its work responsibility for project

### Step 5: Coding the WBS for the Information System
