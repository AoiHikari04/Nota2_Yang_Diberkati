**Chat GPT**
- **Heuristic**: A rule of thumb or a simple way to make decisions quickly. It's like knowing to always put big puzzle pieces in the corners first.

- **Leveling**: Making sure resources (like people or tools) are evenly spread out during the project, even if it takes longer. It’s like spreading peanut butter evenly on bread so every bite tastes the same.

- **Planned Value (PV)**: How much work and money you planned to use by a certain point in the project. It’s like deciding you’ll build half the sandcastle by lunchtime.

- **Resource-Constrained Projects**: Projects where you don’t have unlimited workers or tools, so you need to plan carefully. It’s like building a treehouse with only one hammer and limited wood.

- **Resource Smoothing**: Adjusting tasks so that resources aren’t overloaded but still meeting the deadlines. It’s like making sure your friends don’t all carry too many blocks at once when building a fort.

- **Splitting**: Starting a task, pausing it, and coming back to finish it later. It’s like starting a puzzle, stopping for lunch, then coming back to finish it.
