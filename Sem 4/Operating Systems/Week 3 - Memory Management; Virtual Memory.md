### **1. Introduction**
- **Virtual Memory** removes two key restrictions:
  1. Programs no longer need to be stored **contiguously** in memory.
  2. The **entire program** doesn’t need to reside in memory during execution.
- Four memory allocation schemes are introduced:
  1. **Paged Allocation**
  2. **Demand Paging Allocation**
  3. **Segmented Allocation**
  4. **Segmented/Demand Paged Allocation**

---

### **2. Paged Memory Allocation**
- **How it works**:
  - A program is divided into fixed-size **pages**.
  - Memory is divided into fixed-size **page frames**.
  - Pages are loaded into **non-contiguous** page frames in memory.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient use of memory.
  - No external fragmentation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased overhead due to **page tables** (Job Table, Page Map Table, Memory Map Table).
  - Internal fragmentation (unused space within a page).

---

### **3. Demand Paging**
- **How it works**:
  - Only the **required pages** of a program are loaded into memory.
  - Pages are **swapped** between memory and secondary storage as needed.
- **Advantages**:
  - Allows programs larger than physical memory to run.
  - Efficient memory usage (only active pages are loaded).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Page faults** occur when a required page isn’t in memory, causing delays.
  - Increased overhead due to page swapping and table management.

---

### **4. Page Replacement Policies**
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:
  - The oldest page in memory is replaced.
  - Simple but may replace frequently used pages.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
  - The page that hasn’t been used for the longest time is replaced.
  - More efficient than FIFO but harder to implement.
- **Clock Algorithm**:
  - A variation of LRU that uses a circular queue and reference bits.
  - Balances efficiency and implementation complexity.

---

### **5. Working Set Concept**
- **Working Set**:
  - The set of pages a program actively uses during execution.
  - Keeping the working set in memory minimizes **page faults**.
- **Challenges**:
  - Determining the size of the working set.
  - Managing memory when multiple jobs compete for space.

---

### **6. Segmented Memory Allocation**
- **How it works**:
  - A program is divided into **segments** of varying sizes (e.g., code, data, stack).
  - Segments are loaded into memory dynamically.
- **Advantages**:
  - Logical division of programs (easier for programmers).
  - Reduces page faults by keeping related code/data together.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - External fragmentation (unused gaps between segments).
  - Complex memory management.

---

### **7. Segmented/Demand Paged Allocation**
- **How it works**:
  - Combines **segmentation** and **paging**.
  - Segments are divided into fixed-size pages.
- **Advantages**:
  - Logical benefits of segmentation.
  - Physical benefits of paging (no external fragmentation).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High overhead due to multiple tables (Job Table, Segment Map Table, Page Map Table, Memory Map Table).
  - Slower address translation.

---

### **8. Virtual Memory**
- **How it works**:
  - Creates the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space.
  - Pages or segments are swapped between **main memory** and **secondary storage**.
- **Advantages**:
  - Programs can exceed physical memory size.
  - Efficient memory usage (only active parts are loaded).
  - Supports **multiprogramming** and **code sharing**.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased overhead due to page/segment swapping.
  - Potential performance degradation due to **page faults**.

---

### **9. Key Concepts**
- **Page Fault**: Occurs when a required page isn’t in memory, triggering a swap from secondary storage.
- **Associative Memory**: Used to speed up address translation by storing frequently accessed page/segment info.
- **Fragmentation**:
  - **Internal Fragmentation**: Unused space within a page or segment.
  - **External Fragmentation**: Unused gaps between segments in memory.

---

### **10. Summary**
- **Virtual Memory** revolutionized memory management by:
  - Allowing programs to run without being fully loaded in memory.
  - Enabling efficient use of memory through **paging** and **segmentation**.
- **Challenges**:
  - Managing **page faults** and **swapping overhead**.
  - Balancing **memory efficiency** and **performance**.
- **Modern systems** use a combination of **paging**, **segmentation**, and **demand paging** to optimize memory usage and performance.
