Who is attacking our network?

Four common ways to manage risk are :
1. Risk Acceptance - when solution cost more than the risk
2. Risk Avoidance - eliminating activity to avoid risk altogether
3. Risk Reduction - take action to reduce the risk
4. Risk Transfer - most common, transfer to third party, such as insurance company

Hacker vs Threat Actors

Hackers ->
- A clever programmer
- network professional that use sophiscated programming skills to ensure that networks are not vulnerable to attack
- a person who try to gain unauthorised access to a devices on internet
- person who runs program to prevent or slow access user to a particular website
notes: hacker is not always the bad person

Evolution of threat actor
- Script kiddies - running existing scripts, tools and exploit to cause harm but not for profti
- Vulnerabilities Brokers - grey hat hackers that sell hacks or exploit for rewards
- Hacktivist - people who rally and protest against political and social ideas
- CyberCriminals - black hat hackers that are bad people
- State-Sponsored - steal governmnet secrets, gather intel and sabotage networks of foreign government, terrorist and corporations 

Cybersecurity Tasks -> what we do to manage the risk
- Use a trustworthy IT vendor
- Keep security software up-to-date
- Perform regular penetration tests
- Back up to cloud and hard disk
- Periodically change WIFI password
- Keep security policy up-to-date
- Enforce use of strong passwords
- Use two factor authentication

Cyber Threats Indicators
- every attacks have a pattern indicators 
- IOC, indicators of Compromise
- indicators are the evidence that devices has been compromised/ attacked

example of indicators:
- malware files
- IP address of servers that are used in attacks
- filename
- characteristic changes 
- lagging

indicators of Attacks (IOA) 
- focus more on the motivation
- why attack
- what data are searched/loss/corrupted

Threat actors tools

Tools:
- Password Crackers -> make repeated guesses 
- Wireless hacking tools -> more susceptible to network security threats, tools are used to intentionally hack to search for vulnerabilities
- network scanning and hacking tools -> scans hosts for open UDP and TCP ports
- packet crafting tools -> forge packet to bypass firewall
- packet sniffers -> steal packet
- rootkit detectors -> check file integrity
- fuzzers -> discovers computer systems vulnerabilities
- forensics tools -> trace of evidence existing files, such deleted/hidden files or malware
- debuggers -> reverse engineers binary files when writing exploits or analyze malware
- hacking operating systems -> OS which has preinstall tools
- encryption tools -> safeguard content when store or transmitting
- vulnerabilities exploitation tools -> identify remote host vulnerable to security attacks
- Vulnerabilities scanners -> identify open ports, scans for BYOD, VMs, and client database

Categories of Attacks
- Eavesdropping attack -> capture and listens to traffic
- data modification attack -> altered the data in packet without knowledge of sender or receiver
- IP address spoofing -> tipu ip address
- password-based attacks -> obtains password, then use the account to attack other network
- DOS -> prevent the use of one service
- Man in the Middle -> be the middle man in transfering files, can actively monitor.capture and control the communication transparently
- Compromised Key Attack -> when threat actor obtain the secret key, can be used to gain access to secured communication without sender or receiver bein aware of the attack
- sniffer attack -> read network packet, all of them, even without access to the key
