# First Time Using Github to stores notes

## Will i use it?

## or will it just be a mess of folder that are used only when needed???

**This notes are meant to be shared with others**

if not i will just private it, idk

If have any wrong in my notes can kindly pm me, if no number can ask me at FSKTM, ehek

These Notes are created using Obsidian, if saw any weird HTML stuff is because the GitHub doesnt render some HTML stuff, if i not lazy i fix it
